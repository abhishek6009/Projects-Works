A hump and a hairpiece?\\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\\n(They all stare, bemused.)\\nPhoebe: Just, \\'cause, I don\\'t want her to go through\\nwhat I went through with Carl- oh!\\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a\\ndate. It\\'s just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\\n Time Lapse]\\nChandler: Alright, so I\\'m back in high school, I\\'m\\nstanding in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\\nAll: Oh, yeah.

I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was\\nlooking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-\\n(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet \\'n\\' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned\\non by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that\\'s when it\\nhit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y\\'know, I mean, I always knew looked\\nfamiliar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering \\'Why am I\\ndoing this, and who am I doing this for?\\'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn\\'t know where\\nto go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you\\'re the only person I\\nknew who lived here in the city.\\nMonica: Who wasn\\'t invited to the wedding.\\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn\\'t be an\\nissue...

Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\\n(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)\\nRachel: C\\'mon Daddy, listen to me! It\\'s like, it\\'s\\nlike, all of my life, everyone has always told me, \\'You\\'re a shoe! You\\'re a shoe, you\\'re a\\nshoe, you\\'re a shoe!\\'. And today I just stopped and I said, \\'What if I don\\'t wanna be a\\nshoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y\\'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I\\'m not saying I want you\\nto buy me a hat, I\\'m saying I am a ha- It\\'s a metaphor, Daddy!\\nRoss: You can see where he\\'d have trouble.\\nRachel: Look Daddy, it\\'s my life. Well maybe I\\'ll\\njust stay here with Monica. \\nMonica: Well, I guess we\\'ve established who\\'s\\nstaying here with Monica...\\nRachel: Well, maybe that\\'s my decision. Well, maybe\\nI don\\'t need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\\n Time Lapse, Rachel is breating into a paper bag.]\\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that\\'s it.

Taking control of your life.\\xa0 The whole,\\n\\'hat\\' thing.\\nJoey: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,\\nyou can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he\\'s away a lot.\\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It\\'s her wedding\\nday!\\nJoey: What, like there\\'s a rule or something?\\n(The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)\\nChandler: Please don\\'t do that again, it\\'s a\\nhorrible sound.\\nPaul: (over the intercom) It\\'s, uh,\\nit\\'s Paul.\\nMonica: Oh God, is it\\n6:30?\\xa0 Buzz him in!\\nJoey: Who\\'s Paul?\\nRoss: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\\nMonica: Maybe.

What if\\nthere\\'s only one woman for everybody, y\\'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that\\'s\\nit? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...\\nJoey: What are you talking about? \\'One woman\\'?\\nThat\\'s like saying there\\'s only one flavor of ice cream for you.

I\\'m trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve\\ninterviews today. \\nChandler: And yet you\\'re surprisingly upbeat. \\nRachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty\\npercent off! \\nChandler: Oh, how well you know me... \\nRachel: They\\'re my new \\'I don\\'t need a job, I don\\'t need my parents, I\\'ve got\\ngreat boots\\' boots! \\nMonica: How\\'d you pay for them? \\nRachel: Uh, credit card. \\nMonica: And who pays for that? \\nRachel: Um... my... father. \\n Scene: Monica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is sitting around the kitchen table. \\xa0\\nRachel\\'s credit cards are spread out on the table along with a pair of scissors.]\\nRachel: Oh God, come on you\\nguys, is this really necessary?\\xa0 I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. \\nMonica: C\\'mon, you can\\'t live off your parents your whole life. \\nRachel: I know that. That\\'s why I was getting married. \\nPhoebe: Give her a break, it\\'s hard being on your own for the first time. \\nRachel: Thank you. \\nPhoebe: You\\'re welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was\\nfourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got\\nhere, and I didn\\'t know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,\\ncleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found\\naromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. \\n(Pause) \\nRoss: The word you\\'re looking for is \\'Anyway\\'... \\nMonica: All right, you ready?\\nRachel: No.\\xa0 No, no, I\\'m not\\nready!\\xa0 How can I be ready?\\xa0 \"Hey, Rach!\\xa0 You ready to jump out the\\nairplane without your parachute?\"\\xa0 Come on, I can\\'t do this!\\nMonica: You can, I know you\\ncan! \\nRachel: I don\\'t think so.\\nRoss: Come on, you made\\ncoffee! \\xa0 You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from\\nthat morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)\\nRoss: C\\'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... \\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)\\nRachel: Y\\'know what?\\xa0 I think\\nwe can just leave it at that.\\xa0 It\\'s kinda like a symbolic gesture...\\nMonica:\\xa0 Rachel!\\xa0\\nThat was a library card! \\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\\nChandler: (as Rachel is cutting up\\nher cards) Y\\'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. \\n(She finishes cutting them up and they all\\ncheer.)\\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You\\'re\\ngonna love it! \\n Time Lapse, Rachel and Ross are watching a TV channel finishes it\\'s broadcast day by\\nplaying the national anthem.] \\nMonica: Well, that\\'s it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch? \\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime. \\nMonica: You be okay? \\nRoss: Yeah. \\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What? \\nMonica: That\\'s Paul\\'s watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy.\\nAlright. Goodnight, everybody. \\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\\n(Monica stomps on Paul\\'s watch and goes into her room.)\\nRoss: Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no- \\nRachel: Sorry- \\nRoss: No no no, go- \\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don\\'t want it- \\nRoss: Split it? \\nRachel: Okay. \\nRoss: Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn\\'t know this, but back in\\nhigh school, I had a, um, major crush on you. \\nRachel: I knew. \\nRoss: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica\\'s geeky\\nolder brother. \\nRachel: I did. \\nRoss: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability\\nbecome any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?\\nSometime? Maybe? \\nRachel: Yeah, maybe... \\nRoss: Okay... okay, maybe I will... \\nRachel: Goodnight. \\nRoss: Goodnight. \\n(Rachel goes into her room and Monica enters the living room as Ross is leaving.) \\nMonica: See ya.... Waitwait, what\\'s with you? \\nRoss: I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that\\nmeans.) \\nClosing Credits\\n Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.] \\nJoey: I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here. \\nPhoebe: (sings) I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here... \\nMonica: What? I-I said you had a- \\nPhoebe: (sings) What I said you had... \\nMonica: (to Phoebe) Would you stop? \\nPhoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?\\nAll: Yes!\\nMonica: I said that you had a nice\\nbutt, it\\'s just not a great butt.\\nJoey: Oh, you wouldn\\'t know a great\\nbutt if it came up and bit ya.\\nRoss: There\\'s an image.\\n\\nRachel: (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee? \\nChandler: Did you make it, or are you just serving it? \\nRachel: I\\'m just serving it. \\nAll: Yeah. Yeah, I\\'ll have a cup of coffee. \\nChandler: Kids, new dream... I\\'m in Las Vegas. (Rachel\\nsits down to hear Chandler\\'s dream.)\\nCustomer: (To\\nRachel) Ahh, miss? \\xa0 More coffee? \\nRachel: Ugh. (To another customer that\\'s leaving.) Excuse me, could you give\\nthis to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank\\nyou. (To the gang.)
