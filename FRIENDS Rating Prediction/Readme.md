# Predicting IMDB Rating of FRIENDS episodes using NLP

This project uses bag-of-words on the transcript of an episode of FRIENDS to predict its IMdB rating. The ratings were scraped from IMdB, and the transcripts were 
scraped from https://fangj.github.io/friends/. 

This was a Kaggle competition, and my submission achieved the lowest error and first rank - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/friendsimdbratingprediction/leaderboard
